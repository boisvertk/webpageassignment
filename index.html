        <p class="info">I have been in the industry for 9 years. Working behind the chair is a physically and emotionally demanding job. It's not something one can do forever, so most people look for different trajectories within the industy such as becoming and educator, or owning a salon. I don't have any desire to do either, but I have been craving learning a new skill. I am learning to code with a goal of developing salon software that I think is better suited to specific demands of salons and individuals. There are several areas that I found software I have used were lacking, and I believe I can use me unique experience as a stylist to create a really great program that many independent stylists, and salons will find useful.</p>
